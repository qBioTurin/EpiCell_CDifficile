1	Vegetarian	The vegetarian diets are based on a survey conducted in 1999 by Leblanc et al.(Leblanc, Yoon et al. 2000). The team analysed different type of vegetarian diets whereas the ovo-lacto vegetarian had the highest number of participants. For this reason we designed an ovo-lacto-vegetarian diet which has the dairy and egg products consumption in addition to the fruits and vegetables.  (Elmadfa and Leitzmann 2004).	Leblanc, J. C., H. Yoon, A. Kombadjian and P. Verger (2000). "Nutritional intakes of vegetarian populations in France." Eur J Clin Nutr 54(5): 443-449; Elmadfa, I. and C. Leitzmann (2004).

2	Vegan	A vegan diet is a plant based diet. This type of diet renounce every animal derived product even honey (Elmadfa and Leitzmann 2004)	Elmadfa, I. and C. Leitzmann (2004). Ernaehrung des Menschen, Ulmer.	1991.21	78.56	699.184	35.1134	237.13	948.52	47.6352	58.63	222.794	11.1888	0	0	0	52.53	1.42	120.465
3	EU_average	The "EU diet" was designed based on information from an Austrian Survey. The survey was implemented in the year 2012 and 1002 people from different ages participated being one of the few free available and nutrient- based surveys for European countries (Elmadfa 2012). The "EU diet" can be used as a control which allows us to examine differences in metabolism due to the variability in the nutritional amounts. 	Elmadfa, I. (2012). Oesterreichischer Ernaehrungsbericht 2012. Vienna: 424.	2371.9	107.825	959.643	40.4589	244.195	976.78	41.1814	74.545	283.271	11.9428	10.8	76.68	3.23286	21.515	476.43	115.695
4	Mediterranean	According to Walter C. Willet (Willett, Sacks et al. 1995) , the Mediterranean diet is composed of an abundance of fresh plant foods, minimally processed food, and olive oil as the principal fat source. Dairy products are consumed daily, poultry and fish are consumed in a moderate amount and red meat is consumed in a very low amount. The information for the Mediterranean diet originates from 2 studies (Willett, Sacks et al. 1995, Berendsen, Santoro et al. 2013). The authors did recommendations on typical types of food based on their nutrient composition.	Willett, W. C., F. Sacks, A. Trichopoulou, G. Drescher, A. Ferro-Luzzi, E. Helsing and D. Trichopoulos (1995). "Mediterranean diet pyramid: a cultural model for healthy eating." Am J Clin Nutr 61(6 Suppl): 1402S-1406S; Berendsen, A., A. Santoro, et al. (2013).

5	DACH	This diet is based on the recommended amount of nutrients established by the society for Nutrition in Switzerland Germany and Austria (Elmadfa and Leitzmann 2004). This diet would be the ideal diet to guarantee an adult human being, aged between 19 and 51, a healthy nutritional status.	Elmadfa, I. and C. Leitzmann (2004). Ernaehrung des Menschen, Ulmer.	2148.36	78.94	702.566	32.7024	222.025	888.1	41.3385	104.94	398.772	18.5617	0	0	0	43.74	198.5	84.835
6	High_protein	High protein diet is a typical diet for strength athletes or often prescribed for overweight people for weight loss.(Noakes, Keogh et al. 2005, Raschka and Ruf 2015)	Noakes, M., J. B. Keogh, et al. (2005). "Effect of an energy-restricted, high-protein, low-fat diet relative to a conventional high-carbohydrate, low-fat diet on weight loss, body composition, nutritional status, and markers of cardiovascular health in obese women." Am J Clin Nutr 81(6): 1298-1306.	1791.84	60.605	539.385	30.1023	167.52	670.08	37.3962	135.52	514.976	28.7401	0	0	0	35.585	616.85	68.13
7	Gluten_free	The gluten free diet is based on a 24 hour weight protocol from a subject who suffers from gluten intolerance. As far as we know, there is no survey available about the dietary pattern of people who suffer from severe gluten in tolerance.	NA	2983.83	124.364	1106.84	37.0946	314.75	1259	42.1941	123.182	468.092	15.6876	0	0	0	48.625	174.83	70.52
8	High_fiber	The high fiber diet contains animal derived products and must exceed the fiber amount of the vegan diet which already contains a considerable amount due to the fact that it is mainly composed of fruits, vegetables, nuts and seeds (Waldmann, Koschizke et al. 2003). 	Waldmann, A., J. W. Koschizke, C. Leitzmann and A. Hahn (2003). "Dietary intakes and lifestyle factors of a vegan population in Germany: results from the German Vegan Study." Eur J Clin Nutr 57(8): 947-955.	2435.67	81.13	722.057	29.6452	277.325	1109.3	45.544	105.56	401.128	16.4689	1.05	7.455	0.306077	66.145	407.16	106.08
9	Type_2_diabetes	The diet for type 2 diabetes patient is characterized by high amounts of vitamins and minerals with antioxidative capacities, such as vitamin C and E. The diet is low in kcal because people with a BMI over 30 kg/m2 have a higher risk to develop type 2 diabetes (Nelson, Reiber et al. 2002)	Nelson, K. M., G. Reiber, E. J. Boyko and Nhanes, III (2002). "Diet and exercise among adults with type 2 diabetes: findings from the third national health and nutrition examination survey (NHANES III)." Diabetes Care 25(10): 1722-1728.	2084.57	80.595	717.295	34.4098	216.09	864.36	41.4647	95.185	361.703	17.3514	0	0	0	47.27	322.25	116.235
10	High_fat_low_carb	The high fat diet should imitate a ketogenic diet. The ketogenic diet is often used for patients with epilepsy to lower the gravity of the symptoms (Neal, Chaffe et al. 2008). Unfortunately it wasn't possible to reach the amount of 80% of energy originating from fat without adding specific supplementation. The diet is composed of 1,7% of energy of carbohydrates, 70% of energy of lipids and 24% of energy of proteins. 	Neal, E. G., H. Chaffe, R. H. Schwartz, M. S. Lawson, N. Edwards, G. Fitzsimmons, A. Whitney and J. H. Cross (2008). "The ketogenic diet for the treatment of childhood epilepsy: a randomised controlled trial."

11	Unhealthy	The unhealthy diet was designer to contain a very low amount of dietary fibers, high kcal amount, simple sugars, saturated fatty acids, and cholesterol.	NA	3847.05	210.56	1873.98	48.7122	290.09	1160.36	30.1623	164.14	623.732	16.2132	13.56	96.276	2.50259	13.65	1068.53	134.73
